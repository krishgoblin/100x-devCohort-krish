1. Ecma Script - it is a scripting language specfication standardized for whom soever trying to make a complier fo java script
2. JavaScript - is a scripting language.  common JS browser engines- spiderMonkey(firefox), V8 engine(chrome ka compiler)
3. Node.js - it is a runtime enviorment for js
4. Bun- it is also a runtime enviorment for js but faster than node.js although it is also single threaded.
It is written Zig.

What all things can be done using Node.js
-create a video player, game, clis(Command line interafce)
-create a Http server.(IMP)

what is an Http server
-Hyper text transfer protocol
-It is a protocol that is a way for machines(Browsers) so that websites's frontend can talk to its backend.

Things client side need for a http server
- protocol (http/ Https)
- address(ip/url)
- route (Path)
- header, body, footer (some input)
- method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

server side 
- response headers 
- response body
- response code

DNS(domain name system)
- mapping of url names to actual IP addresses.
- establishes the connection to an IP using handshaking techniques.

Creating our own HTTP server in Node.js using [express] library
- refer index.js file in HTTP server folder. run the file and search for localhost:3000(on which ever port number you selected) on browser.
- express is just a library which is written by some smart people fo us so that we doesn't have to 
create a server in C everytime from scratch.  
(use npm install express to install it in directory).
(use node <filename>).

There can be other ways as well to expose our logic to the world.

REQUESTS
-GET => get something in the form of header OR going to get a checkup.
-POST => going to get a new kidney..like updating the value.
-PUT => going to get the kidney replaced..like performing some logic on the data like making it all positive or something.
-DELETE => going to get the kidney removed..as the name suggests deleting some data.

Express-
res.send("Used to send Some text")
res.json({"Used to send json files"})

To get post body request as inputs in our code we should use-
app.use(express.json()); //This is a Middleware in itself // more on it in next class.

To make the server work we have to use-
app.listen(<portnumber>);  // at the last
