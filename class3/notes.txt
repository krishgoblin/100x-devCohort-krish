-How to authenticate?
Answers-Middlewares
-It is used to checkup whatever inputs we need to check from user.
-An ugly way of doing it writing the auth check code part in every path again and again.

-Rather we should make Middlewares which is basically wrapping up the auth check code into a function  
and then use it in routes "app.get('/',usermiddleware, kidneymiddleware //these are checks// , function(req,res){})
wherever needed.  REFER to Middlewares.js for more clarity.

-usernames and passwords should be sent in headers.

-to use Middlewares universely we use app.use(<middleware_name>); //before the app.get or post or other routes.

-INPUT VALIDATION
//we can use something called global catches.
REFER to Middlewares.js for more clarity.
