-How to authenticate?
Answers-Middlewares
-It is used to checkup whatever inputs we need to check from user.
-An ugly way of doing it writing the auth check code part in every path again and again.

-Rather we should make Middlewares which is basically wrapping up the auth check code into a function  
and then use it in routes "app.get('/',usermiddleware, kidneymiddleware //these are checks// , function(req,res){})
wherever needed.  REFER to Middlewares.js for more clarity.

-usernames and passwords should be sent in headers.

-to use Middlewares universely we use app.use(<middleware_name>); //before the app.get or post or other routes.

-INPUT VALIDATION
//we can use something called global catches.
REFER to Middlewares.js for more clarity.

-HASHING -> it is one way. we can only hash it using the hashing function but we cannot dehash it.
-Encryption -> it is two. it's like we can encrypt and decrypt the value if we have the key. 
-Json WEB Tokens(JWT) -> Similar to Encryption(in jwt anyone can decode) but can only be verfied by the company or backend specifically.
[we can also say JWT is like a digital signature. anyone can see it but only the bank can verfy  it.]
-Local Storage -> Token is stored into this.
